The files in this repo are the data used in the above manuscript, and in most cases are presented as the cleaned up version here. Some of the data are also associated with the following publications:

* Heyduk et al., 2016. Gas exchange and leaf anatomy of a C3â€“CAM hybrid, Yucca gloriosa (Asparagaceae). _Journal of Experimental Botany_ 67(5): 1369-1379.

* Heyduk et al., 2019. Shared expression of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) genes predates the origin of CAM in the genus Yucca. _Journal of Experimental Botany_.

See below for descriptions of individual files and what they contain. 

* All_LICOR.csv - Contains A (umol CO2 m-2 s-1) and conductance (mol H20 m-2 s-1) values on all individual plants measured, from all three _Yucca_ species (_Y. aloifolia, Y. filamentosa_, and _Y. gloriosa_). Data from 2016 and 2019 publications included. Note that the data from 2016 had a slightly different experimental design ("treat" column). 

* All_titrations_raw.csv - Raw titration data for individual plants (all three species). Separated by day ("D1", "D7", or "D9") and time ("AM", "PM"). Data from 2019 pulication included, data from 2016 omitted (data was messy, was omitted from analysis).

* All_Traits_summary.csv - Summary table of all traits included in major analyses, across all individual plants measured. 

* Cell_sizes_rawdata.csv - Raw cell size data collected on all three species, from both the current study as well as the 2016 publication (remeasured for this study).

* Leaf_crosssects_rawdata.csv - Raw cross sectional data (except for cell sizes, those are means of n=5 cells) on both current set of samples as well as re-measured samples from 2016 pulication. 

* Stomatal_density.csv - stomatal density values (raw) for current set of samples as well as values from 2016 publication.
